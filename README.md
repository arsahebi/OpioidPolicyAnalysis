# Introduction
This repository contains a series of R scripts and Markdown files developed for the analysis of opioid policies in the United States. The project aligns with the research presented in the paper "Understanding the Impact of Opioid Policies: An Analytical Study" published in the Healthcare journal (MDPI). Link to the paper.

# File Descriptions
\textbf{GitCleaned__DataPrep1__V01.R}: This script handles the initial data preparation phase, including data cleaning and standardization processes.
GitCleaned__DataPrep2__V01.R: A continuation of the data preparation process, focusing on more advanced data manipulation and transformation tasks.
GitCleaned__ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Method.Rmd: A Markdown document detailing the methodologies used in the project, aligned with the methods described in the referenced paper.
GitCleaned__ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Plot.Rmd: This Markdown file contains code for generating plots and visualizations of the data analysis, reflecting the findings and graphical representations seen in the paper.

# Dependencies and Setup
To run these scripts, ensure you have R and RStudio installed. Required R packages include dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, among others. Install these packages using install.packages("package_name").

# Usage Instructions
1. Start by running GitCleaned__DataPrep1__V01.R for initial data processing.
2. Proceed with GitCleaned__DataPrep2__V01.R for further data preparation.
3. Review the GitCleaned__ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Method.Rmd for an understanding of the methodologies.
4. Execute GitCleaned__ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Plot.Rmd to generate visualizations.

# Reference to the Paper
This project's analysis and methodology are closely tied to the study presented in "Understanding the Impact of Opioid Policies: An Analytical Study." The paper details comprehensive approaches to evaluating opioid policies in the U.S., which have been foundational in structuring the analyses performed in these scripts.
