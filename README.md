# Introduction
This repository contains a series of R scripts and Markdown files developed for the analysis of opioid policies in the United States. The project aligns with the research presented in the paper "Understanding the Impact of Opioid Policies: An Analytical Study" published in the Healthcare journal (MDPI).

# File Descriptions
`ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__DataPrep1.R`: This script handles the initial data preparation phase, including data cleaning and standardization processes.
`ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__DataPrep2.R`: A continuation of the data preparation process, focusing on more advanced data manipulation and transformation tasks.
`ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Method.Rmd`: A Markdown document detailing the methodologies used in the project, aligned with the methods described in the referenced paper.
`ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Plot.Rmd`: This Markdown file contains code for generating plots and visualizations of the data analysis, reflecting the findings and graphical representations seen in the paper.

# Dependencies and Setup
To run these scripts, ensure you have R and RStudio installed. Required R packages include dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr, among others. Install these packages using install.packages("package_name").

# Usage Instructions
1. Start by running `ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__DataPrep1.R` for initial data processing.
2. Proceed with `ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__DataPrep2.R` for further data preparation.
3. Review the `ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Method.Rmd` for an understanding of the methodologies.
4. Execute `ProjectUSOpioidPolicy__Plot.Rmd` to generate visualizations.
